  Anvilman6:
  - rscadd: Adds footwraps and related infrastructure to the game!
  - wip: Wraps should be functional at this stage, but there are a few modular additions
      I will be looking at later. Such as adding them to vendors, potentially adding
      sound effects to them, or potentially adding other types of wraps beyond Common/Security.
      Suggestions are welcome here.
  - tweak: Added more infrastructure to footwear. Shoes can be flagged as digitigrade
      usable or not for easy modular additions.
  - tweak: Creates more aggressive cases of item state updating and checking for shoes,
      so be advised if designing shoes with alternative view states.
  - imageadd: Item sprites, wrap on-character sprites, and situational side view sprites!
      I am not a spriter, so if people think these need touchups, I would welcome
      spriter input and help for a patch.
